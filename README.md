In today's increasingly connected world, the ability to control devices remotely has become essential. One practical application of this technology is controlling an LED light using a microcontroller, such as an Arduino, in conjunction with a mobile app. This project combines hardware and software components to provide users with the ability to easily manage their lighting systems from anywhere.
Hardware Overview
At the core of this system is the Arduino microcontroller. The Arduino board serves as the central processing unit that receives commands from the mobile app and controls any attached devices, in this case, an LED light. To set up our system:
Components Needed:
An Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
An LED (preferably RGB for color variations)
A resistor appropriate for limiting current through the LED
A relay module (if controlling high-voltage lights)
A breadboard and jumper wires for connections
Wi-Fi module (e.g., ESP8266 or ESP32) to enable communication over Wi-Fi.
Wiring:
The wiring involves connecting the LED with resistors to suitable GPIO pins on the Arduino board. If employing a relay module for higher voltage applications, it's connected in parallel with the light source controlled by one of these GPIO pins
Software Development
The second part of our project involves creating both firmware for the Arduino and developing a user-friendly mobile application.
Arduino Firmware:
The firmware is programmed using C/C++ within the Arduino IDE:
The code will establish communication via Wi-Fi using libraries like ESP8266WiFi or WiFi.h.
It listens for incoming commands—such as turning on/off or changing colors—sent from an external source.
On receiving data, it checks what action needs to be taken (e.g., toggle power state or change color dynamically).
Mobile Application Development:
Developing cross-platform apps can be done through frameworks like React Native or Flutter:
The app provides users with buttons/sliders allowing them to turn lights on/off and adjust brightness or colors.
It connects via HTTP requests over REST API calls made possible by integrating libraries such as Axios in React Native.
user Experience
Upon installation:
Users connect their smartphone app directly over local network/Wi-Fi.
They can seamlessly control multiple LEDs if necessary by sending commands specific only to desired lights/rooms without direct physical interaction.
